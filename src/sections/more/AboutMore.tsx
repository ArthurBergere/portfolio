          <p>
            My story started with curiosity for technology, which quickly turned into 
            a passion for web development. From my very first project to my current 
            work, I've been driven by the desire to build meaningful and user-friendly 
            applications...
          </p>
        </SectionBlock>

        <SectionBlock title="âš½ Hobbies & Lifestyle">
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active with sports, exploring new 
            cultures through travel, and diving into photography. These passions 
            fuel my creativity and give me fresh perspectives when I come back to 
            the keyboard.
          </p>
        </SectionBlock>

        <SectionBlock title="ðŸŽ¨ Creative Side">
          <p>
            In addition to development, I design logos, posters, and visual identities. 
            This creative practice allows me to combine aesthetic sense with 
            technical problem-solving.
